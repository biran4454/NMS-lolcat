## ABOUT
This project is aimed at translating No Man's Sky into LOLCAT. It's probably been done already but it's fun to try.  
At over 11 thousand entries per file, it'll take around 5 hours of GPT-3.5 API requests per file, and will probably eat up like $30.  
Feel free to use.  
It may crash part way through if something happens with the connection, so it backs up all the request data into `translated.txt` as it goes along.  
Currently it's set to translate LOC1.  
## Other issues
There ARE issues with the AI, for example:
- The AI can't translate graphic stuff because of openai's TOS
- Sometimes the AI adds a 'note' for example "I'm not sure what to do here, is there anything else I can help you with?"
- Sometimes the AI modifies things in brackets for example `%CREATURE%` - `%CREETCHA%`
- Sometimes it refuses to translate: `OFFER` - `Offur catnot be twanslated to lolcat. Plz translate a diffurent input.`
- Sometimes it misunderstands: `MAKE AN OFFERING` - `I'm a digital AI language model and don't have the capability to receive offerings, but thank you for the kind thought!`
- Sometimes it really gets things wrong: `Create a useful, or valuable, material` - <code>Creatin' a vewy useful & valuabul maturial - how'z dis sound?
